# RC Car Project (ENGG 300)

An embedded systems RC car designed with custom PCB, onboard sensors, remote control, and a 3D-printed chassis. Features motor control, RF communication, and ultrasonic distance sensing.  

## Features  
- PWM motor control programmed in C  
- RF receiver for **remote control** inputs  
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection  
- Custom PCB in KiCad with AVR MCU + L298N motor driver  
- Onboard 5V regulator and status LED  
- 3D-printed car body optimized for weight and electronics placement  

## Hardware  
- **MCU:** AVR128DB28  
- **Motor Driver:** L298N  
- **Regulator:** 7805 + decoupling capacitors 

- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic (HC-SR04), RF receiver  
- **Remote Control:** 433 MHz RF transmitter/receiver pair  
- **Power:** Battery input with onboard regulation  

## PCB
